# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
# 
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# In[1]:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head(1000)


# ### Question 0 (Example)
# 
# What is the first country in df?
# 
# *This function should return a Series.*

# In[2]:

# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero()


# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[3]:

def answer_one():
    return df['Gold'].argmax()
    #df.loc['United States']
answer_one()


# ### Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[5]:

def answer_two():
    maxValue = 0
    maxColumn = 0
    for i in range(len(names_ids)-1):
        goldSummer = df['Gold'][i]
        goldWinter = df['Gold.1'][i]
        diffGoldSW = abs(goldSummer - goldWinter)
#         print(diffGoldSW)
#         print(goldSummer-goldWinter)
#         print("--")
        if (diffGoldSW > maxValue):
            maxValue = diffGoldSW
            maxColumn = i
#             print(maxValue)
#             print("---")
    return (names_ids[maxColumn][0])
#     return (df['Gold']-df['Gold.1']).argmax()
answer_two()


# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 
# 
# $$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$
# 
# Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[6]:

def answer_three():
    copy_df = df.copy()
    maxVal = 0
    maxIndex = 0
    for i in range(len(names_ids)-1):
        goldSummer = copy_df['Gold'][i]
        goldWinter = copy_df['Gold.1'][i]
        totalGold = copy_df['Gold.2'][i]
        if (goldSummer > 0 and goldWinter > 0):
            total = (abs(goldSummer - goldWinter))/totalGold
            if(total > maxVal):
                maxVal = total
                maxIndex = i
    return (names_ids[maxIndex][0])
#     copy_df = df.copy()
#     copy_df = copy_df[(copy_df['Gold']>0) & (copy_df['Gold.1']>0)]
#     return ((copy_df['Gold']-copy_df['Gold.1'])/copy_df['Gold.2']).argmax()
answer_three()            


# ### Question 4
# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
# 
# *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

# In[16]:

def answer_four():
    copy_df = df.copy()
    copy_df['Points'] = (copy_df['Gold.2']*3) + (copy_df['Silver.2']*2) + (copy_df['Bronze.2']*1)
    return(copy_df['Points'])
answer_four()


# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
# 
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
# 
# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[8]:

census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head(50)


# In[9]:

def answer_five():
    return(census_df['STNAME'].value_counts().argmax())
answer_five()


# ### Question 6
# **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
# 
# *This function should return a list of string values.*

# In[10]:

def answer_six():
    cp_census = census_df.copy()
    cp_census = cp_census.sort_values(by=['CENSUS2010POP'], ascending=False).head(3)
    return(cp_census['STNAME'].values.T.tolist())
answer_six()


# ### Question 7
# 
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# 
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[111]:

def answer_seven():
    cp_census = census_df[['STNAME','CTYNAME','POPESTIMATE2015','POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2012','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2010']]
    cp_census = cp_census[cp_census['STNAME'] != cp_census['CTYNAME']]
    index = abs((cp_census.max(axis=1) - cp_census.min(axis=1))).argmax()
    return(cp_census.loc[index]['CTYNAME'])
answer_seven()


# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 
# 
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# 
# *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

# In[103]:

def answer_eight():
    return census_df[(census_df['REGION'] < 3) & (census_df['CTYNAME'].str.startswith('Washington', na=False)) & (census_df['POPESTIMATE2015'] > census_df['POPESTIMATE2014'])][['STNAME','CTYNAME']]
answer_eight()
